									<h1>Personal Projects </h1>
									<p>This sample contains a few of my personal projects, which highlight my application of quantitative analysis skills.</p>
								</header>
								<ul>
									<li><h2> The Stock Market Project</h2></li>
									<ul>
										<li>  The Stock Market is either a quants best friend or most hated enemy, as at any second, the market can change from being in favor of a financial package to ruining it. This is why understanding the stock market is crucial to anyone who aspires to work as a quant. This project was led by me, and as a group we analyzed the stock market trends for four different types of companies, each one with a different volatile level. Leading this successful project, I have shown full competence of the stock market. Here is our detailed report <a href="Website/_Stock Market Project.pdf">[link]</a></li>
									</ul>
									<li><h2> Music Mash</h2></li>
									<ul>
										<li> Music Mash is a Candy Crush replicate computer game that I created using Java Object-Oriented Programing, a programming language quants must show mastery in. In this game, I created a Javafx GUI board that hosted different album covers. Players then could combine similar album covers, just like candy in candy crush, and then a random snippet of music from that album would play. The successful functioning of my game shows my competence in object-oriented programming, assuring that I am ready for basic quantitative development.</li>
										<li>Here is the game development summary: <a href="Website/_Music Mash.pdf">[link]</a></li>
									</ul>
									<li><h2>Vallco Shopping Mall Redevelopment Analysis Project</h2></li>
										<ul>
											<li>This was a research project I conducted to determine the financial practicality of the controversial Vallco Shopping Mall. This highlights my skills as an analytical researcher, as the report shows a complete list of financial consequences if the redevelopment plan is imposed by the Cupertino.</li>
											<li>Link to <a href="Website/vallcoreport.pdf">[Report] </a> and <a href = "Website/Vallco Presentation.pdf">[Presentation]</a></li>
										</ul>
									<li><h2>World Eats-Global Cuisine Restraint</h2></li>
										<ul>
											<li> World Eats is another project that I lead. In this project, my group created a full business plan for opening and managing a restaurant. This project highlights my management and organizational skills, as this plan was successfully implemented. I will use my management and origination skills to create successful quantitative financial portfolios. </li>
											<li> Here is the World Eats Company Plan: <a href= "Website/World Eats.pdf">[link]</a></li>
										</ul>
										<li><h2>Banza Designer Co.</h2></li>
											<ul>
												<li>Banza is a designer shoe company plan I created. In this report, I demonstrate my risk management analysis skills as I create a company portfolio and assessed everything a CEO would do for their company. This report outlines everything about my company, from my mission statement to competitor analysis. This project allowed me to develop fundamental quantitative skills, such as risk analysis and portfolio development.
</li>

											</ul>
									<li><h2>Personal Life Project</h2></li>
										<ul>
											<li>This project highlights my financial management skills as I decided to create a future plan for an aspiring computer engineer in the Bay Area. I created this portfolio to allow people to follow this plan and limit their financial expenditures.  This project demonstrates my competence in the quantitative skill of financial management and portfolio creation</li>
											<li> <a href="Website/Budgeting Project.pdf">[View Report Here]</a></li>
										</ul>

									<li><h2>Canva Projects</h2></li>
										<ul>
											<li>  I personally develop many graphical art projects, including magazines, company logos, and brand promotions, using tools such as photoshop, procreate, and illustrator. All of these projects highlight my creatively, an important trait for front office quants who theorize new ways to formulate financial prediction models. Each part of every graphical project was thoroughly thought out before implementation, just like quants who do the same while creating financial portfolios</li>
											<li><h3>Switzerland Business Magazine</h3></li>
												<ul>
													<li> A informative magazine I created to highlight the multiple business and financial practices in the marketing world of Switzerland. This magazine highlights my large scale analysis skills, as I successfully summarize a countryâ€™s business habits in a few informative pages.<a href="Website/Switzerland Project Magazine.pdf"> [Link Here] </a></li>

													<li><h3>Revolutionaries Magazine</h3></li>
